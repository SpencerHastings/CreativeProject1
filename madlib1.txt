A vacation is when you take a trip to some output1 place with your output2 family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an output3 or up on a/an output4. A good vacation place is one where you can ride output5 or play output6 or go hunting for output7. I like to spend my time output8 or output9. When  parents  go  on  a  vacation,  they  spend  their  time  eating three output10 a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around output11. Last summer, my little brother fell  in  a/an output12 and  got  poison output13 all over  his output14. My  family  is  going  to  go  to  (the) output15, and I will practice output16. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very output17 and because they have to work output18 hours every day all year making enough output19 to pay for the vacation.
